## 🔒 Identity and Access Management System for Aged Care

ElderSafe Connect is a comprehensive Identity and Access Management (IAM) system designed
specifically for aged care facilities. The platform implements robust security features to protect sensitive
health information while providing role-based access control for administrators, nursing staff, and
caregivers.

## 🎓 Academic Project Information

```
University : Swinburne University of Technology
Unit Code : ICT30017
Unit Name : ICT Project A
Submission Date : May 18, 2025
Instructor : Dr Kaberi Naznin
```
## 📋 Project Overview

ElderSafe Connect was developed to address security and access management challenges faced by aged
care facilities. The system implements a layered security approach to protect sensitive resident data while
ensuring appropriate staff members can access the information required for their roles.

### Key Features

```
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) : Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) integration with QR
code setup
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) : Granular access permissions for administrators, nurses, and
carers
JWT Authentication : Secure session management using JSON Web Tokens
Password Security : Strong password policies with bcrypt hashing and HIBP verification
Honeypot System : Deceptive security mechanism to detect and track potential intruders
Activity Logging : Comprehensive monitoring of user actions and security events
Supabase Integration : Secure database and authentication backend
Resident Care Plans : Role-appropriate access to health information
```

```
Responsive Design : Mobile-friendly interface for use across devices
```

## 🔧 Technology Stack

```
Backend : Python with Flask
Database : PostgreSQL via Supabase
Authentication : Supabase Auth with JWT tokens
Frontend : HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Security : bcrypt, PyOTP, JWT, HIBP API
Email : SMTP integration for notifications and password resets
```
## 🚀 Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

```
Python 3.13.3 or higher
Supabase account
SMTP-enabled email account for system notifications
```
### Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository:
2. Create a virtual environment:

```
bash
git clone https://github.com/Kajal-Dhanjal/ICT-Project-A.git
```
```
bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
4. Create a .env file with the following variables:
5. Create the required certificates for HTTPS:

### Running the Application

1. Start the main application:
2. Access the application:
    Main application: https://localhost:5000
    Honeypot system: http://localhost:3000/login

### Logging in as ADMIN
agedcare66.adnim@gmail.com
Password: PA_CL7_T01

**This admin shall never be removed or have its password changed.**
You will be able to create more admins and other staff in the admin page. 

## 💼 Usage

1. **Admin Functions** :
    Invite new staff members
    Create resident profiles
    Assign staff to residents
    Monitor system logs
2. **Nurse Functions** :
    Create and update care plans
    Record resident vitals
    Upload and access medical documents
3. **Carer Functions** :

```
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_key
SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_flask_secret
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_signing_key
```
```
bash
mkdir -p security_protocols/TLS/cert
cd security_protocols/TLS/cert
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -out cert.pem -keyout key.pem -days 365
```
```
bash
python app.py
```

```
View assigned resident information
Access care plans (read-only)
```
## 🔄 Development Workflow

The project was developed using an Agile-inspired approach with two major sprints:

```
Sprint 1 : Core security infrastructure (JWT, MFA, RBAC, Honeypot)
Sprint 2 : User experience enhancements, password reset functionality, and visual refinements
```
## 🔒 Security Features

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Users are required to set up MFA using authenticator apps that implement Time-based One-Time
Passwords (TOTP). This provides an additional layer of security beyond password authentication.

### Password Security

```
Strong password requirements (length, complexity)
Bcrypt hashing with salting
Integration with Have I Been Pwned API to prevent use of compromised passwords
Secure password reset functionality
```
### Honeypot System

A decoy system designed to detect unauthorized access attempts. Triggers email alerts to administrators
when potential intrusions are detected.

### Access Control

Granular role-based access control ensures users can only access information relevant to their
responsibilities:

```
Admins: full system access
Nurses: write access to assigned residents
Carers: read-only access to assigned residents
```
## 📊 Monitoring

The system includes comprehensive logging for:

```
Authentication attempts
JWT token issuance and validation
Honeypot triggers
```

```
User activities (care plan submissions, etc.)
```
